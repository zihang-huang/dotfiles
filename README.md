My configuration files

# Current Ideas 2025/10/25

I gave up on keeping my nice Neovim setup working across different OSes and hardwares. Too many compatibility issues, and I kept having to manually set up stuff for every individual computer. So I just switched to Lazygit’s default config instead.

Haven’t done any customization yet — the plan is to set up my custom:

- [ ] Keybindings
- [ ] Snippets
- [ ] See is there any latest plugins/add-ons that I'm interested?
- [ ] The default lazygit config starts really slow, loading tons of plugins, probably disable some that I don't really need?

I switched to wezterm for my terminal emulator, because it's truely cross platform on Linux/macOS/Windows, so I can keep my configuration and keybindings across all these platforms. Same reason for starship.

Also, ranger sucks, and I switched to yazi.
